What is a Shortcut in Microsoft Fabric?\n","\n","In Microsoft Fabric, a Shortcut is a logical link (pointer) to data stored elsewhere, either inside OneLake or in an external storage system (like Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or AWS S3).\n","\n","Instead of physically importing or copying data, the shortcut creates a virtual mount inside your Lakehouse or Warehouse so the data appears as if itâ€™s stored locally â€” but it actually stays in its original location.\n","\n","### ðŸ“Œ Analogy:\n","Think of a shortcut as a Windows desktop shortcut to a file on your network drive.
